NMF Composites
============

An NMF Composite is a software component that consists of interconnected services based on the NMF Generic Model specialized for a certain purpose and to be deployed on the NanoSat segment or Ground segment. The NMF Composites are based on SOA’s service composability design principle that encourages reusing existing services and combine them together to build an advanced solution.

The objective of the NMF Composites is to provide prebuilt components that allow quick development of new software solutions that are interoperable in end-to-end scenarios.

The design of the NMF Composites is done in a modular and flexible manner which allows them to be reconfigured or adapted depending on the needs in the overall design of the system. This is similar to a Lego® type approach where the bricks can be recombined to form something different.


The family of NMF Composites is the following:
- NanoSat MO Monolithic
- NanoSat MO Supervisor
- NanoSat MO Connector
- Ground MO Adapter
- Ground MO Proxy



The names for the NMF Composites follow the convention: <Segment> MO <Purpose>
