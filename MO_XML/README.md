MO XMLs
============

This project includes the necessary XML files for the NanoSat MO Framework:
* COM services
* Software Management services
* Platform services


The Common services and the M&C services do not need to be present as they can be dynamically linked directly from the respective projects.


The COM services are like the standardized version with 2 additional extensions:
* Pagination Filter for queries
* ArchiveSync service defined for the NMF
